# React Typescript Webpack application

It's an application where were gathered configurations, settings and other useful things for creating an app on React library.
You can config it on your own without any limitations.

There are technologies which were used there:
- React, Typescript, Webpack(obviously lol)
- SCSS
- Eslint
- Jest, React-testing-library as test environment

Configs which you can find there:
- webpack's configs (development, production)
- eslint config
- tests config
